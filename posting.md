# posting

posting system is where we post to mailboxes, our flyers of Team Mirai. this differs from the poster-map, as poster maps are for large billboards throught out the city (14,000 in Tokyo), posting is for all houses through out tokyo.

so are usecase for posting will be 
- we have a map (same as poster)
- users can draw on the map, the route they will post. 
- users can choose to edit or move/zoom the map

my guess is we use a plugin that will allow drawing. 

the new map will be on /posting

## to do later
- the draw data (line data) will live in the server for now, but in the future we will want a data store for that. maybe sqlite in the server.
- add auth
